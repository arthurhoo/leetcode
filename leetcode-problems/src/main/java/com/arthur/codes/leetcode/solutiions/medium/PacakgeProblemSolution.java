 */

/**
 * You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
 * Note that we have only one quantity of each item, In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively.
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don’t pick it (0-1 property).
 */

/**
 * Input:

 The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
 Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines.
 The first line consists of N the number of items.
 The second line consists of W, the maximum capacity of the knapsack.
 In the next  line are N space separated positive integers denoting the values of the N items and
 in the fourth line are N space separated positive integers denoting the weights of the corresponding items.

/**
 * Output:

 Print the maximum possible value you can get with the given conditions that you can obtain for each test case in a new line.

/**
 * Constraints:

 1≤T≤100

 1≤N≤100

 1≤W≤100

 1≤wt[i]≤100

 1≤v[i]≤100
